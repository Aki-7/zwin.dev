# System requirements
The following environments have been confirmed for running Zen (→[What is Zwin?](/what_is_it/what_is_zwin)).

## PC
### OS
Supported operating systems are:
- Ubuntu22.04 LTS
- Arch Linux

### Graphics
Unlike typical PCVR, a high-powered GPU is not required on the PC.
This is because the headset handles rendering in Zwin (→[Rendering Scheme](/what_is_it/rendering_scheme))

The PC's GPU must support OpenGL ES 3.2. The following laptop PCs have been confirmed for operation:

- Lenovo ThinkPad X13 Gen2
 - CPU: 11th Gen Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-1165G7 @ 2.80 GHz
 - GPU: TigerLake-LP GT2 [Iris Xe Graphics]

## Wired Connection
Currently, Zwin requires a fast USB cable to reliably send the texture of windows between the PC and headset. Although wireless support is in development, wired connection is currently recommended due to several issues (→[Roadmap](/roadmap)).

- A port faster than USB3.0 is recommended on the PC side.
- A high-quality cable with enough power supply is required.
  - [Meta's certified cable](https://www.meta.com/ja-jp/help/quest/articles/headsets-and-accessories/oculus-link/) is the most recommended.
  - Although it is possible to use a low-quality cable, problems such as slow movement of Ray when opening multiple windows may occur.


## VR Headsets
Compatible with the following headsets:

- Meta Quest 2
- Meta Quest Pro

Although Quest 1 can also be used, it is not recommended due to rendering performance issues.
