# Uninstallation

If you want to delete the resources related to Zwin or Zen, you can easily uninstall them with [zen-release-manager](https://github.com/zwin-project/zen-release-manager) which is used in [Installation](/en/getting_started/installation).
```
$ cd /path/to/zen-release-manager
$ sudo ./zen-release uninstall
```

Now, you can return to your preferred desktop environment, such as the default window system on Ubuntu.
