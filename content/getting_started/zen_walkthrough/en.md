# Zen walkthrough
This page shows how to use Zen, following the real use case in the [Walkthrough of Zwin](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZEDEfEZB1w&t=2s)

## System Requirement
To use Zen, you only need a PC running Ubuntu or Arch Linux, and a Meta Quest 2 or Pro headset, along with a cable to connect them. The PC doesn't have to be gaming PCs; just a regular laptop is enough.

## Using Zen in 2D screen
In Ubuntu, you can choose the Windowing system to use in the unlock screen. Click "ZEN" to launch 2D Zen.


In 2D Zen, you can use regular Linux apps as-is, such as Google Chrome and terminal. 

## Switching to VR
If you click "VR" button in the bottom-right corner of the screen, you can see the list of available VR headsets.


Once you open Zen Mirror with Quest connected to the PC, Zen recognizes the headset, and the headset is added to the list.


By clicking "Connect" button on the right, you can start Zen in VR mode with the headset.

## Interactions in VR
In VR, the windows you were using in 2D are displayed as-is. 

You use [Ray](https://www.zwin.dev/what_is_it/interactions_on_zen#ray) to interact with the VR world. Ray works as a cursor. If you move the mouse, Ray follows that movement.

By clicking the launcher icons in the menu bar below, you can open windows in [Board](https://www.zwin.dev/en/what_is_it/interactions_on_zen#board). By dragging & dropping the windows, you can move windows to another Board. Board itself can be moved in the same way.

## 3D Windows
If you open the file explorer from the launcher icon and double-click a stl file, the file is opened in our 3D app, "Zen Object Viewer". It shows 3D model in thr VR world. If you point Ray to the 3D model and scroll, the models rotate. The model works as a 3D window, so you can also move it with dragging & dropping.

## Coming back to 2D screen

If you start to feel tired while using VR, you can put off the headset and come back to the 2D mode.

You can access the Boards you used in VR with the switcher in the bottom of the screen. The windows on the Boards are preservered even after you exit the VR mode.
